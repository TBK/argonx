Open source `steamclient.dll` / `steamclient.so` replacement.

Requires `libzmq`, `libprotobuf`, `libcrypto++`, `libarchive`, `libpthread`

Built on the work done by [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) and [Steam++]( https://github.com/seishun/SteamPP). However aiming for a different goal - binary interoperability with what already exists.
