# argonx [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/emily33901/argonx/master.svg?logo=CircleCI)](https://circleci.com/gh/emily33901/argonx/tree/master)

Open source `steamclient.dll` / `steamclient.so` replacement.

## Caution:
argonx relys some **very specific** implementation defined behaviour (Like assuming what register `this` gets passed in and the structure of virtual call thunks which are generated by the compiler).

I personally use clang-7 on linux and msvc-v141 on windows. Not compiling with either of these may result in **very hard to find segfaults**. A proper testing mechanism will be set with ci in the future.

Requires `libzmq`, `libprotobuf`, `libcrypto++`, `libarchive`, `libpthread`

Built on the work done by [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) and [Steam++]( https://github.com/seishun/SteamPP). However aiming for a different goal - binary interoperability with what already exists.
