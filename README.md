# argonx [![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/github/emily33901/argonx/master.svg?logo=CircleCI)](https://circleci.com/gh/emily33901/argonx/tree/master)

Open source `steamclient.dll` / `steamclient.so` replacement.

Built on the work done by [SteamKit2](https://github.com/SteamRE/SteamKit) and [Steam++]( https://github.com/seishun/SteamPP). However aiming for a different goal - binary interoperability with what already exists.

## Building:
Requires `libzmq`, `libprotobuf`, `libcrypto++`, `libarchive`, `libpthread`
```
git clone https://github.com/emily33901/argonx.git
git submodule update --init --recursive

cd argonx
chmod +x tools/patch-externals.sh
tools/patch-externals.sh

./make.sh
```

## Caution:
argonx relys some **very specific** implementation defined behaviour (Like assuming what register `this` gets passed in and the structure of virtual call thunks which are generated by the compiler).

I personally use clang-7 on linux and msvc-v142 on windows. Not compiling with either of these may result in **very hard to find segfaults**. A proper testing mechanism will be set with ci in the future. (Recently upgraded to v142 as the result of bad codegen in v141 in Buffer)
